# Feature Specification: UV Package Management Migration

**Feature Branch**: `002-uv-migration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "make changes to project default to leverage uv, not venv"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Developers need a faster, more efficient Python package management solution that reduces environment setup time and improves dependency resolution reliability compared to the current venv-based approach.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer setting up the project for the first time, **When** they follow the setup instructions, **Then** they can create a Python environment and install dependencies faster than with venv
2. **Given** a developer running the setup process, **When** they execute the environment creation command, **Then** all project dependencies are resolved and installed without conflicts
3. **Given** an existing venv-based development environment, **When** a developer migrates to the new system, **Then** they can continue development without losing any functionality
4. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline, **When** it runs the new setup commands, **Then** the build process completes successfully and faster than before
5. **Given** multiple developers on different platforms, **When** they use the new package management system, **Then** they get consistent dependency versions and behavior
6. **Given** the project documentation, **When** developers read the setup instructions, **Then** they can understand how to use the new package management system without prior knowledge

### Edge Cases
- What happens when developers have existing venv environments and need to migrate?
- How does the system handle dependency conflicts during installation?
- What occurs when the new package manager is not installed on a developer's system?
- How does the system behave on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)?
- What happens when network connectivity is poor during package installation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Setup and Installation**
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide faster environment creation than traditional venv
- **FR-002**: System MUST install project dependencies more efficiently than pip with venv
- **FR-003**: System MUST resolve dependency conflicts automatically when possible
- **FR-004**: System MUST work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing Python project structure

**Developer Experience**
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST provide clear migration instructions from venv
- **FR-007**: Setup instructions MUST be simple and require minimal commands
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing development workflow and scripts
- **FR-009**: Error messages MUST be clear and actionable for common issues
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both development and production environment setups

**Integration and Compatibility**
- **FR-011**: System MUST work with existing CI/CD pipelines
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing package requirements
- **FR-013**: System MUST support the same Python versions as current setup
- **FR-014**: System MUST integrate with existing development tools and IDEs
- **FR-015**: System MUST support both local development and containerized environments

**Performance and Reliability**
- **FR-016**: Environment creation MUST complete faster than venv equivalent
- **FR-017**: Package installation MUST be more reliable than current pip-based setup
- **FR-018**: System MUST cache dependencies to improve subsequent installations
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle network interruptions gracefully during installation
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide reproducible builds with locked dependency versions

**Migration and Transition**
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide clear path for migrating from existing venv setup
- **FR-022**: Documentation MUST be updated to reflect new package management approach
- **FR-023**: Existing scripts MUST be updated or replaced to use new system
- **FR-024**: System MUST allow developers to verify migration was successful
- **FR-025**: Rollback process MUST be available if migration causes issues

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Environment Configuration**: Represents the Python environment setup with package specifications and dependency locks

- **Migration Guide**: Represents documentation and procedures for transitioning from venv to new system
- **Setup Scripts**: Represents automated commands and procedures for environment creation and dependency installation
