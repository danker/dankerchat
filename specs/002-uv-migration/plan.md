# Implementation Plan: UV Package Management Migration

**Branch**: `002-uv-migration` | **Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/edanker/development/dankerchat/specs/002-uv-migration/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Migration from traditional Python venv/pip to uv package manager for faster environment setup, better dependency resolution, and improved developer experience across the DankerChat project.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (unchanged)  
**Primary Dependencies**: uv (new package manager), existing project dependencies  
**Storage**: N/A (tooling change only)  
**Testing**: pytest (unchanged), uv sync verification  
**Target Platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows development environments  
**Project Type**: tooling (affects existing web application structure)  
**Performance Goals**: 50%+ faster environment setup, 30%+ faster dependency installation  
**Constraints**: Must maintain backward compatibility, preserve existing development workflows  
**Scale/Scope**: Single project migration, affects all developers and CI/CD

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (tooling migration, no new projects) - within limit
- Using framework directly? Yes (uv directly, no wrapper scripts)  
- Single data model? N/A (no data involved)
- Avoiding patterns? Direct uv usage, no complex abstractions

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (tooling change, not feature code)
- Libraries listed: N/A (migration affects existing libraries)  
- CLI per library: Existing CLI structure preserved
- Library docs: Update existing docs with uv instructions

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes - migration tests before implementation
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes - verify scripts fail then implement  
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes for migration verification
- Real dependencies used? Yes - actual uv installation and project dependencies
- Integration tests for: uv environment creation, dependency installation, CI/CD compatibility
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes - migration script logging
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (tooling change only)  
- Error context sufficient? Yes - clear error messages for migration issues

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.1 (BUILD increment for tooling change)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes  
- Breaking changes handled? Migration guide, rollback procedures

```

**Structure Decision**: Tooling change affects existing web application structure but preserves all current directories

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Identified:
1. **uv vs venv performance comparison** - Quantify speed improvements and limitations
2. **uv project structure best practices** - pyproject.toml configuration patterns
3. **uv workspace configuration** - Managing backend/frontend dependency separation  
4. **uv CI/CD integration** - GitHub Actions and deployment compatibility
5. **uv cross-platform compatibility** - Windows/macOS/Linux installation and usage
6. **uv migration strategies** - Safe transition from requirements.txt to pyproject.toml
7. **uv caching and reliability** - Dependency resolution and network handling

### Research Consolidation:
Executing research phase to resolve uv configuration decisions and create research.md with migration strategy.

## Phase 1: Design & Migration Plans
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Planned Outputs:
1. **migration-guide.md**: Step-by-step instructions for developers to migrate from venv to uv
2. **rollback-guide.md**: Procedures to revert to venv if issues arise  
3. **quickstart.md**: Updated setup instructions using uv for new developers
4. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Add uv-specific development context and commands

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base  
- Generate from Phase 1 migration docs: pyproject.toml creation, dependency migration
- Generate from rollback guide: backup procedures, reversion scripts
- Generate from research: cross-platform testing, CI/CD updates
- Implementation tasks: script updates, documentation changes

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Backup/safety tasks first (preserve current state) [P]
- Research verification tasks (uv installation, basic functionality) [P]  
- Core migration: pyproject.toml → dependency migration → script updates
- Documentation updates → CI/CD updates → verification tests
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent configuration files)

**Estimated Output**: 18-22 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, verify migration success, performance benchmarks)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - all checks pass*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking  
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS

- [x] Complexity deviations documented

*Based on Constitution principles - Library-first (preserved), Test-first, CLI interfaces (preserved), Observability*
