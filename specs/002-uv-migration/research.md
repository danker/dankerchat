# Research: UV Package Management Migration

**Feature**: UV Package Management Migration  
**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Phase**: 0 - Technical Research

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. UV vs Venv Performance Comparison

**Decision**: UV provides significant performance improvements over venv/pip  
**Rationale**: 
- Environment creation: 10-50x faster than venv (written in Rust vs Python)
- Dependency resolution: 10-100x faster with parallel downloads
- Caching: Global cache reduces repeated downloads across projects
- Lock files: Deterministic builds with faster subsequent installations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Poetry: Slower than uv, more complex configuration
- Pipenv: Similar speed to pip, maintenance concerns  
- Conda: Different ecosystem, overkill for simple Python projects

**Performance Benchmarks** (typical Python web project):
- venv + pip: 45-120 seconds initial setup
- uv: 3-15 seconds initial setup, 1-3 seconds subsequent syncs

### 2. UV Project Structure Best Practices

**Decision**: Use pyproject.toml with uv-specific configuration sections  
**Rationale**:
- Standard Python packaging (PEP 518) with uv extensions
- Single file for dependencies, build config, and tool settings
- Better dependency resolution than requirements.txt approach
- Supports development dependencies and optional dependency groups

**Configuration Pattern**:
```toml
[project]
name = "dankerchat"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
    "flask>=2.3.0",
    "sqlalchemy>=2.0.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.4.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
]

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
]
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep requirements.txt: Loses uv-specific benefits
- Multiple config files: More complex to maintain

### 3. UV Workspace Configuration

**Decision**: Single-root workspace with backend/frontend separation  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains existing project structure
- Allows shared dependencies at root level
- Backend-specific dependencies in backend/ subdirectory
- Frontend remains unchanged (Node.js ecosystem)

**Workspace Structure**:
- Root `pyproject.toml`: Shared Python dependencies and workspace config
- `backend/` subdirectory: Backend-specific dependencies if needed
- Global uv.lock: Single lock file for reproducible builds

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate workspaces: More complex, unnecessary for current structure
- Monolithic dependencies: Harder to separate concerns

### 4. UV CI/CD Integration

**Decision**: GitHub Actions with uv-based workflow  
**Rationale**:
- Official uv GitHub Action available
- Faster CI builds (3-5x speedup typical)
- Built-in caching support
- Simple migration from existing pip workflows

**GitHub Actions Pattern**:
```yaml
- name: Set up uv
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
  
- name: Install dependencies  
  run: uv sync --all-extras --dev
  
- name: Run tests
  run: uv run pytest
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep pip in CI: Slower, inconsistent with local development
- Docker-based CI: More complex, unnecessary change

### 5. UV Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Decision**: UV works consistently across Windows/macOS/Linux  
**Rationale**:
- Single binary installation on all platforms
- Consistent command syntax across platforms
- Built-in Windows path handling
- No platform-specific workarounds needed

**Installation Methods**:
- Standalone installer: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Package managers: brew, winget, apt (when available)
- Python: `pip install uv` (fallback)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Platform-specific solutions: Unnecessary complexity
- Manual installation: Error-prone for team setup

### 6. UV Migration Strategies

**Decision**: Gradual migration with backward compatibility  
**Rationale**:
- Convert requirements.txt to pyproject.toml automatically
- Keep requirements.txt temporarily for compatibility
- Migrate CI/CD after local development proven
- Provide rollback procedures for safety

**Migration Steps**:
1. Install uv alongside existing venv
2. Generate pyproject.toml from requirements.txt
3. Test uv environment creation and dependency installation
4. Update documentation and scripts
5. Migrate CI/CD workflows
6. Remove requirements.txt after confirmation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Big-bang migration: Risky, harder to rollback
- Keep both systems: Maintenance burden

### 7. UV Caching and Reliability

**Decision**: UV's global cache with network resilience  
**Rationale**:
- Global cache at `~/.cache/uv/` (Linux/macOS) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` (Windows)
- Automatic retry logic for network failures
- Offline mode when packages cached
- Cache invalidation handles package updates correctly

**Reliability Features**:
- Atomic installations (all-or-nothing)
- Lock file ensures reproducible builds
- Automatic dependency conflict resolution
- Graceful fallback for network issues

**Alternatives Considered**:
- No caching: Slower repeated installations
- Manual cache management: Error-prone

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Component | Technology | Configuration |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Package Manager | uv | 0.4+ (latest stable) |
| Configuration | pyproject.toml | PEP 518 + uv extensions |
| Lock File | uv.lock | Auto-generated, committed to repo |
| Installation | uv sync | Replaces pip install -r |
| Development | uv run | Replaces source venv/bin/activate |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | astral-sh/setup-uv@v3 |

## Migration Strategy Confirmed

### Phase 1: Local Development
- Install uv alongside existing venv setup
- Create pyproject.toml from existing requirements
- Test environment creation and dependency installation
- Update local development scripts

### Phase 2: Documentation and Training  
- Update README.md with uv setup instructions
- Create migration guide for existing developers
- Update CLAUDE.md with uv commands and context
- Create rollback procedures

### Phase 3: CI/CD Migration
- Update GitHub Actions workflows
- Test CI builds and deployment
- Monitor performance improvements
- Remove old pip-based workflows

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- Remove requirements.txt files after verification
- Clean up old venv-related scripts
- Archive migration documentation

## Performance Expectations

- **Environment Setup**: 50%+ faster than venv
- **Dependency Installation**: 30%+ faster than pip
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: 3-5x faster builds
- **Developer Onboarding**: Reduced from 5-10 minutes to 1-2 minutes
- **Disk Usage**: Reduced through global caching

## Risk Mitigation

- **Rollback Plan**: Keep requirements.txt until migration verified
- **Testing**: Verify all existing functionality works with uv
- **Documentation**: Clear migration instructions and troubleshooting
- **Gradual Rollout**: Local dev → CI/CD → team adoption
- **Support**: uv has active community and corporate backing (Astral)

## Next Phase Requirements

All research questions resolved:
- ✅ Performance benchmarks: 50%+ setup speed improvement
- ✅ Configuration pattern: pyproject.toml with uv sections
- ✅ Workspace structure: Single-root with backend separation
- ✅ CI/CD integration: GitHub Actions with official uv action
- ✅ Cross-platform support: Consistent experience all platforms
- ✅ Migration strategy: Gradual with rollback procedures
- ✅ Caching and reliability: Global cache with network resilience
