# Feature Specification: Chat Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-chat-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we're going to build a simple and elegant chat application. We'll leverage basic username/password authentication to begin with, but expand to other authentication options over time.  A user should be able to chat at least 3 different ways to begin: web-based chat (both direct messages to others as well as named chat rooms/channels, via the command line and REST API.  We'll need a basic admin interface that will facilitate at least the following to begin: add/edit/delete users, set permission and roles, moderate channels, add/edit/remove channels.  The primary web interface should be modern and elegant.  The core of the application and the REST API should be built in Python+Flask. The project should leverage websockets and modern web frameworks for responsive design."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a communication platform where they can send messages to each other privately or in group discussions, with the flexibility to access these conversations through multiple interfaces based on their current context and preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a registered user with valid credentials, **When** they log in through any interface, **Then** they can access their conversations and send messages
2. **Given** a user in a chat room, **When** they send a message, **Then** all other users in that room receive the message in real-time
3. **Given** two users with accounts, **When** one sends a direct message to the other, **Then** only the recipient can see the message
4. **Given** an administrator logged into the admin interface, **When** they create a new channel, **Then** users can discover and join that channel
5. **Given** a user accessing via command line, **When** they send a message, **Then** users on web interface see the same message immediately
6. **Given** an administrator, **When** they disable a user account, **Then** that user cannot access any interface or send messages

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to send a message to a deleted/disabled user?
- How does system handle when a user is removed from a channel while actively chatting?
- What occurs when message delivery fails due to connectivity issues?
- How does system behave when maximum channel capacity is reached? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum users per channel not specified]
- What happens when a user tries to join a private/restricted channel?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Authentication & Access**
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create accounts with username and password

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an individual with access to the chat system, has credentials, profile information, assigned roles and permissions

- **Channel**: Represents a named discussion space where multiple users can communicate, has name, description, member list, access controls
- **Direct Conversation**: Represents a private communication thread between exactly two users
- **Role**: Represents a set of permissions that can be assigned to users (e.g., admin, moderator, regular user)
- **Session**: Represents an active user connection to the system through any interface
