# Implementation Plan: Chat Application

**Branch**: `001-chat-application` | **Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/edanker/development/dankerchat/specs/001-chat-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Multi-interface chat application supporting direct messages and channels through web, CLI, and REST API with admin functionality. Built as libraries with Flask backend, WebSocket real-time messaging, and modern responsive web frontend.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-SocketIO, SQLite/PostgreSQL, pytest, Click  
**Storage**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production  
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-flask, pytest-asyncio  
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS server, modern web browsers  
**Project Type**: web (frontend + backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms message delivery, 100 concurrent users initially  
**Constraints**: <100MB memory per server instance, WebSocket persistent connections  
**Scale/Scope**: 100 users initially, 10 channels, message history retention

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 3 (backend-api, frontend-web, cli-client) - within limit
- Using framework directly? Yes (Flask, no wrappers)  
- Single data model? Yes (shared between all interfaces)
- Avoiding patterns? Direct SQLAlchemy models, no Repository pattern

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes - auth, messaging, channels, admin as separate libs
- Libraries listed: 
  - `chat-auth`: User authentication and session management
  - `chat-messaging`: Direct messages and real-time delivery  
  - `chat-channels`: Channel management and group messaging
  - `chat-admin`: User/channel administration
- CLI per library: Each with --help/--version/--format JSON support
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned for each

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes - tests written first, must fail
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes - contract tests first  
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes - actual SQLite/PostgreSQL, real WebSockets
- Integration tests for: All library interfaces, WebSocket connections, multi-client sync
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes - JSON logs with correlation IDs
- Frontend logs → backend? Yes - unified logging stream  
- Error context sufficient? Yes - user ID, session ID, timestamp context

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes  
- Breaking changes handled? API versioning, migration scripts planned

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application structure due to web interface + REST API + CLI requirements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Identified:
1. **Flask-SocketIO best practices** - Real-time messaging architecture
2. **Multi-client session management** - Shared sessions across interfaces  
3. **SQLAlchemy patterns** - Efficient queries for chat history
4. **WebSocket scaling** - Handling concurrent connections
5. **CLI design patterns** - Interactive vs command-line chat interfaces
6. **Authentication flow** - JWT vs sessions for multi-interface access
7. **Message delivery guarantees** - Ensuring reliable real-time delivery

### Research Consolidation:
Executing research phase to resolve technical approach decisions and create research.md with findings.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts  
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Planned Outputs:
1. **data-model.md**: User, Message, Channel, DirectConversation, Role, Session entities with relationships
2. **contracts/**: OpenAPI specs for REST API endpoints, WebSocket event schemas
3. **Contract tests**: Failing tests for each API endpoint and WebSocket event
4. **quickstart.md**: User guide for setting up and using the chat application
5. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Add chat-specific development context

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base  
- Generate from Phase 1 contracts: API endpoint tests, WebSocket event tests
- Generate from data model: SQLAlchemy model creation, database migrations  
- Generate from user stories: Multi-interface integration tests
- Implementation tasks: Library code to make all tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Contract tests first (API, WebSocket) - must fail [P]
- Database models and migrations [P]  
- Authentication library → messaging library → channels library → admin library
- Frontend components → CLI client → integration tests
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent libraries)

**Estimated Output**: 28-32 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - all checks pass*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking  
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
