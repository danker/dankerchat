# Research: Chat Application Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Chat Application  
**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Phase**: 0 - Technical Research

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Flask-SocketIO Best Practices - Real-time Messaging Architecture

**Decision**: Flask-SocketIO with Redis message broker  
**Rationale**: 
- Native Flask integration with minimal complexity
- Built-in room management for channels 
- Redis backend enables scaling across multiple server instances
- Well-documented patterns for authentication and session management

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure WebSockets: More complex session/auth integration
- Django Channels: Would require switching entire framework
- Node.js + Socket.io: Different language stack

### 2. Multi-client Session Management - Shared Sessions Across Interfaces

**Decision**: JWT tokens with Redis session store  
**Rationale**:
- Stateless tokens work across REST API, WebSocket, and CLI
- Redis provides fast session lookup and invalidation
- Enables consistent user state across all interfaces
- Easy to implement logout/session termination

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Server-side sessions only: Difficult for CLI and API clients
- Database sessions: Slower lookup, more database load
- Pure stateless JWT: No ability to revoke sessions

### 3. SQLAlchemy Patterns - Efficient Queries for Chat History

**Decision**: SQLAlchemy with relationship loading and message pagination  
**Rationale**:
- `lazy='select'` for user relationships to avoid N+1 queries
- Pagination with `offset/limit` for message history
- Indexes on `timestamp`, `channel_id`, and `user_id`
- Separate queries for direct messages vs channel messages

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Raw SQL: More performant but breaks ORM consistency
- NoSQL: Adds complexity for user/channel relationships
- Graph database: Overkill for simple message threading

### 4. WebSocket Scaling - Handling Concurrent Connections

**Decision**: Flask-SocketIO with eventlet worker and Redis pub/sub  
**Rationale**:
- Eventlet handles many concurrent connections efficiently
- Redis pub/sub broadcasts messages across server instances
- Built-in room management scales to multiple processes
- Graceful connection handling and reconnection support

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Gunicorn workers: Doesn't support WebSocket scaling
- Celery for message distribution: More complex, unnecessary overhead
- Direct pub/sub implementation: Reinventing wheel

### 5. CLI Design Patterns - Interactive vs Command-line Chat Interfaces

**Decision**: Click-based CLI with both modes  
**Rationale**:
- `chat interactive` for real-time chat mode
- `chat send <message>` for scripting/automation
- Consistent with library CLI pattern from constitution
- JSON output mode for programmatic use

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Interactive-only: Bad for scripting and automation
- Command-only: Poor user experience for chat sessions
- Custom CLI framework: Reinventing click

### 6. Authentication Flow - JWT vs Sessions for Multi-interface Access

**Decision**: JWT with refresh tokens  
**Rationale**:
- Works seamlessly across web, CLI, and REST API
- Refresh tokens handle expiration gracefully
- Can embed user roles and permissions in token
- Redis blacklist for logout/revocation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session cookies only: Doesn't work for CLI/API clients
- Basic auth: Insecure, doesn't scale
- OAuth integration: Too complex for initial version

### 7. Message Delivery Guarantees - Ensuring Reliable Real-time Delivery

**Decision**: At-least-once delivery with client acknowledgments  
**Rationale**:
- Database persistence ensures no message loss
- WebSocket acknowledgments confirm delivery
- Client reconnection fetches missed messages by timestamp
- Simple retry logic for failed deliveries

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Exactly-once delivery: Complex distributed systems problem
- Fire-and-forget: Unacceptable message loss
- Queue-based messaging: Adds significant complexity

## Technical Decisions Summary

| Component | Technology | Version/Pattern |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Backend Framework | Flask | 2.3+ |
| Real-time | Flask-SocketIO | 5.3+ with eventlet |
| Database ORM | SQLAlchemy | 2.0+ |
| Message Broker | Redis | 7.0+ |
| Authentication | JWT + Redis | PyJWT 2.8+ |
| CLI Framework | Click | 8.1+ |
| Testing | pytest + pytest-flask | 7.4+ |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | 18.2+ |
| WebSocket Client | Socket.io-client | 4.7+ |

## Architecture Patterns Confirmed

1. **Library Structure**: Each major feature (auth, messaging, channels, admin) as separate library
2. **Testing Strategy**: Contract tests → Integration tests → Unit tests
3. **Data Flow**: REST API for CRUD operations, WebSockets for real-time events
4. **Session Management**: JWT tokens with Redis backing
5. **Message Flow**: Client → API → Database → Redis → WebSocket broadcast
6. **CLI Integration**: Same backend libraries, different interface layer

## Performance Considerations

- **Message Pagination**: 50 messages per page default
- **Connection Limits**: 100 concurrent WebSocket connections initially  
- **Message Retention**: 90 days default (configurable)
- **Redis Memory**: Estimate 1MB per 1000 active sessions
- **Database Indexes**: timestamp, user_id, channel_id for fast queries

## Next Phase Requirements

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items resolved:
- ✅ Authentication methods: JWT with refresh tokens
- ✅ Message retention: 90 days configurable  
- ✅ User roles: admin, moderator, user (expandable)
- ✅ Moderation capabilities: delete messages, ban users, mute users
- ✅ Performance targets: <200ms delivery, 100 concurrent users
- ✅ Channel capacity: 50 users per channel initially
- ✅ Concurrent users: 100 initially, scalable with Redis
