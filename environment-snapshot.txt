# Python Environment Snapshot - Pre-UV Migration
# Date: 2025-09-07
# Task: T003 - Document current Python environment
# Purpose: Baseline documentation before UV package manager installation

## Python Installation
Python Version: 3.13.5
Python Location: /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
Installation Method: Homebrew (macOS)

## Package Management
pip Status: Not available in current environment
Installed Packages: None (clean environment)

## Environment Configuration  
Virtual Environment: None active
Python Environment Variables: None set
PATH (Python-related entries):
  - /Users/edanker/.local/bin
  - /usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin  
  - /opt/homebrew/bin
  - /opt/homebrew/sbin

## System Information
Operating System: macOS (Darwin)
Shell: bash/zsh (from PATH context)
Terminal Environment: Windsurf IDE (/Users/edanker/.codeium/windsurf/bin)

## Current Project State
Project Structure: Specification-driven development framework
Dependencies: None installed yet (project in planning phase)
Build System: None configured
Package Configuration: No pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, or setup.py

## Notes
- Clean Python 3.13.5 installation via Homebrew
- No virtual environments currently active  
- No project dependencies installed yet
- Perfect baseline for UV migration implementation
- Python version exceeds UV migration requirement (3.11+)

## Expected Changes After UV Migration
- UV package manager will be installed
- pyproject.toml will define project dependencies
- uv.lock will provide dependency locking
- .venv/ directory will be created by UV
- Project dependencies will be installed via UV

## Rollback Reference
To restore this exact environment state:
1. Ensure Python 3.13.5 via Homebrew
2. Remove any UV installations
3. Clear any virtual environments
4. No additional packages to uninstall (clean state)
